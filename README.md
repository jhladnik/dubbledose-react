# Dubbledose V2.0

The purpose of this project is to create a full stack MERN app with the the Dubbledose web app concept.

## Optimizations:
Optimizations to the original web app if time allows, should include:

* Calendar for history of usage, this will include a modal with the daily medications and a mood/energy tracker
* Forgot username or password option that will send the information to the users email
* Push notification to the user if a scheduled dose was not taken; this will include additional fields when the substance is created
